###### Physics Lecture:

- Energy Storage in a Capacitor:
	- Work done to move a single discrete charge: $W_{ext}=q\Delta V$
	- The work done by the entire plate is given by the integral $W_{ext}=\int^{Q}_{0}Vdq$ which evaluates into $U=W_{ext}=\frac{Q^2}{2C}$
	- This energy is stored in the charge arrangement.
	- Alternatively, it can also be thought of as being stored in the electric field.
- The Effects of Dielectrics in Capacitors:
	- Placing a conductive layer between two plates: $C_0=\frac{A\varepsilon_0}{d-w}$.
	- This effectively reduces the distance between the two plates.
	- An insulative layer (completely filling the gap between plates) reduces the electric field as described by $C=\frac{\kappa A\varepsilon_0}{d}$, $\kappa$ is some factor greater than 1 that describes the polarization of the material.
	- Both increase capacitance.
