- Regular Language:
	- A language is regular if and only if it is recognized by some finite state automaton.
	- Set operations on Languages:
		- Union: $A\cup B$
		- Concatenation: $A\circ B=\{xy\space|\space x\in A$ and $y\in B\}$
		- Star: $A*=\{x_1\space x_2\dotsb x_k\space|\space k\geq0$ and $x_i\in A\}$
		- Regular languages are closed under the union operation as demonstrated below:
			- Let $M_1=(Q_1,\Sigma,\delta_1,q_1,F_1)$ recognize language $A_1$ and $M_2=(Q_2,\Sigma,\delta_2,q_2,F_2)$ recognize language $A_2$
			- $M$ that recognizes $A_1\cup A_2$:
				- $Q=\{(r_1,\space r_2)\space|\space r_1\in Q_1$ and $r_2\in Q_2\}$ (the cartesian product)
				- $\Sigma$ in this example is the same for both machines, otherwise $\Sigma=\Sigma_1+\Sigma_2$
				- $\delta$
				- $q$
				- $F$
