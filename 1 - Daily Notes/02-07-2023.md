###### Algorithms:
- [[(PLACEHOLDER TEXT)|Previous Lecture]]
- Randomization:
	- can manifest in two ways:
		- Random Input (called Probabilistic Analysis)
		- Random Algorithms (encryption, Pseudo-random number generators)
	- Set of all possible outcomes is referred to the sample space denoted $\Omega=\{H,T\}$
	- Probability is a measure of uncertainty.
		- Two schools Frequentist (repeatable) and Bayesians (non-repeatable based on "reasonable expectations").
		- can be discrete or continuous.
	- $\Omega=\{\omega_1,\,\omega_2\ldots,\,\omega_n\}$
	- Specific outcome: $\omega\in\Omega$
	- Probability of an event $A$ is denoted $P(A)$
	- Important properties:
		- $0<P(A)<1$
		- $P(\Omega)=1$
		- $P(A^C)=1-P(A)$
		- Disjointed events $P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)$
		- $P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$
		- $P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$
		- If $A$ and $B$ are independent events then $P(A|B)=P(A)$
	- A random variable maps $X:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ and is a mathematical representation of physical meaning.
		- One example is the indicator function defined as:
		$1_A(x)=\begin{cases}
		1,\qquad\text{if }x\in A\\
		0,\qquad\text{otherwise}
		\end{cases}$
	- Expected value: $E(X)=\sum^{n}_{i=1}p_ix_i$
	- The goal of a sorting algorithm is to reduce the number of swaps.
