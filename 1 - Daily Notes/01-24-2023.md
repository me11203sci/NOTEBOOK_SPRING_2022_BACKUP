- Homework #1 due February 3rd
- $f(n)=\Theta(g(n))$:
	- this means that the function $f(n)$ is tightly bounded by $g(n)$, meaning that there exits two constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that for values of $n\geq n_0$ $f(n)$ is sandwiched between $c_1\cdot g(n)$ and $c_2\cdot g(n)$.
	- Mathematically: $\exists\space c_1, c_2,n_0\space s.t.\space\forall\space n\geq n_0:0\leq c_1\cdot g(n)\leq f(n)\leq c_2\cdot g(n)$
