-  Capacitors:
	- Devices that store charge ad can be used to deliver a large, short pulse of charge.
	- Charge per electric potential is called capacitance denoted as $C=\frac{Q}{\Delta V}$
	- Litany for Finding Capacitance:
		1. Determine the electric field using gauss's law ($\oint_S\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}=\frac{q_{ENCLOSED}}{\varepsilon_0}$.)
		2. Determine $\Delta V$ using $\Delta V=-\int\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{s}$.
		3. Then use $C=\frac{Q}{\Delta V}$
