###### Algorithms:
- [[01-24-2023#Algorithms:|Previous Lecture]]
- Transitivity:
	- Prove: if f(n)=\theta(g(n)) and g(n)=\theta(h(n))), then f(n)=\theta(h(n))
		- By definition: 
		$f(n)=\theta(g(n))$<=>$\exists\space c_1,c_2,n_0\space s.t.\space\forall\space n\geq n_0$
- Reflexivity:
- Symmetry:
- Recursion:
	- A function that calls itself directly or indirectly.
	- We assume that each line takes a single unit of cost.
	- Substitution method: using the definition of the function, but is reliant on making a guess in regards to the base case.
	- Recursive Tree: constructed via recursive expansion.
