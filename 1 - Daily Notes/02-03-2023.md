###### Theory:
- [[02-01-2023#Theory:|Previous Lecture]]
- DFAs transition to a state, while NFAs transfer to a state.
- Computation on a NFA:
	- A string $w=y_1y_2\textellipsis y_m$ where $y_m\in\Sigma_\varepsilon$
	- A NFA $N$ accepts $w$ if there exists a sequence of states that:
		1. Starts at $q_0$
		2. $r_{i+1}=\delta(r_i,\,)$
		3. $r_m\in F$
- If two machines are the same language, then they are equivalent.
- A language is regular if there is either a DFA or NFA that accepts it.
- DFAs and NFAs are equally powerful, but an NFA might be simpler.
