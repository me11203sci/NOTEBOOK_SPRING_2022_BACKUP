###### Algorithms:
- [[(PLACEHOLDER TEXT)|Previous Lecture]]
- Sorting:
	- The goal of sorting is the arrange all the entries in the input in an increasing order.
	- Insertion Sort:
		- Incremental design style.
		- Best-Case: $O(n)$
		- Worst-Case: $O(n^2)$
		- Average-Case: $O(n^2)$
		- Space: $O(1)$ (NOTE: Space complexity only considers any memory needed in addition to the input array.)
	- Merge Sort
		- Recursive design style.
		- Trade off better run complexity for increase in space complexity.
		- Best-Case: $O(n\log n)$
		- Worst-Case: $O(n\log n)$
		- Average-Case: $O(n\log n)$
		- Space: $O(n)$
	- Heap Sort
		- Can we get the run time of merge and the space complexity of insert?
		- iterative desd
		- Best-Case: $O(n\log n)$
		- Worst-Case: $O(n\log n)$
		- Average-Case: $O(n\log n)$
		- Space: $O(1)$
		- Caveat:  data must be given in a heap or otherwise a heap must be constructed.
		- Heaps:
			- Binary tree
			- Give index $i$ (max-heap property): 
				- parent: $\lfloor i/2\rfloor$
				- left child: $2i$
				- right child: $2i+1$
