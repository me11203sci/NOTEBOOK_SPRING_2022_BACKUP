###### Theory of Computer Science:
- [[01-20-2023#Theory of Computer Science:|Previous Lecture]]
-   $\delta$ maps an ordered pair of a state from $Q$ and a element from $\Sigma$.
- A language may not contain the $\lambda$ and $\varepsilon$ characters, as they represent the empty string.
- The machine in question defines the language it accepts.

###### Physics II:
- [[01-18-2023#Physics II:|Previous Lecture]]
- Continuous Charge Distributions:
	- The formulas we have dealt with so far involve discrete charges.
	- $\vec{F}=\int^{x_f}_{x_i}k\frac{dQq}{r^2}\hat{r}$
	- Litany:
		- Need to find $r$ and $\hat{r}$ in terms of $x$; $dQ$ in terms of $dx$
		- $dQ=dx\lambda=\frac{Q}{L}$, where $\lambda$ is the charge density (charge per length).
		- Given $a$ as a length from the the x-axis along the y-axis, $\lim_{a\rightarrow\infty}\frac{2k\lambda a}{x\sqrt{x^2+a^2}}\hat{i}=\frac{2k\lambda}{x}\hat{i}$ 
	- Recall length along an arc: $R\phi$ given that $\phi$ is in radians.
	- Differential:
		- Length $dx$
		- Area $dxdy$
		- Length along arc $Rd\phi$
		- Area in polar coordinates $(dr)(rd\phi)$
	- Charge per:
		- length $\lambda$
		- area $\sigma$
		- volume $\rho$
