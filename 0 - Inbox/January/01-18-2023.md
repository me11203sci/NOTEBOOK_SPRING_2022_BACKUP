###### Physics II:
- [[GENESIS|Previous Lecture]]
- Charge:
	- intrinsic property of matter, describes how strongly object interact electrically.
	- Positive and Negative charges; like charges repel; opposites attract.
	- Charge is quantized, in our case expressed in terms of $e=1.6\times 10^{-19} C$, where $C$ is coulombs.
	- Neutrally charged particles do not interact electrically, though they can still interact electrically as free charges within them can split in the presence of a charged object.
	- Net charge is a conserved property (Law of Conservation of Charge.)
	- Force is proportional to the product of the charges as described by $$\vec{F}=k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2_{12}}\hat{r}_{12}$$
		- The $12$ subscripts means that $\vec{F}$ is the force felt by particle 2 exerted by particle 1.
		- $r_{12}$ is the distance between the two particles and $\vec{r}_{1\rightarrow 2}$ is a unit vector that points away from the first charge in the direction of the second.  
	- State versus Unstable:
		- Marble in bowl is stable because even if your disturb it slightly, the marble will roll back toward the bottom of the bowl.
		- Whether an equilibrium position is stable/unstable depends on the signs of the charges.
